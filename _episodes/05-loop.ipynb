    "**Loops** are a programming construct which allow us to repeat a command or set of commands\n",
    "for each item in a list.\n",
    "As such they are key to productivity improvements through automation.\n",
    "Similar to wildcards and tab completion, using loops also reduces the\n",
    "amount of typing required (and hence reduces the number of typing mistakes).\n",
    "Suppose we have several hundred genome data files named `basilisk.dat`, `minotaur.dat`, and\n",
    "`unicorn.dat`.\n",
    "For this example, we'll use the `creatures` directory which only has three example files,\n",
    "but the principles can be applied to many many more files at once.\n",
    "The structure of these files is the same: the common name, classification, and updated date are\n",
    "presented on the first three lines, with DNA sequences on the following lines.\n",
    "Let's look at the files:\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ head -n 5 basilisk.dat minotaur.dat unicorn.dat\n",
    "```\n",
    "{: .language-bash}\n",
    "We would like to print out the classification for each species, which is given on the second\n",
    "line of each file.\n",
    "For each file, we would need to execute the command `head -n 2` and pipe this to `tail -n 1`.\n",
    "We’ll use a loop to solve this problem, but first let’s look at the general form of a loop:\n",
    "```\n",
    "for thing in list_of_things\n",
    "do\n",
    "operation_using $thing    # Indentation within the loop is not required, but aids legibility\n",
    "done\n",
    "```\n",
    "{: .language-bash}\n",
    "and we can apply this to our example like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ for filename in basilisk.dat minotaur.dat unicorn.dat\n",
    "> do\n",
    ">     head -n 2 $filename | tail -n 1\n",
    "> done\n",
    "```\n",
    "{: .language-bash}\n",
    "```\n",
    "CLASSIFICATION: basiliscus vulgaris\n",
    "CLASSIFICATION: bos hominus\n",
    "CLASSIFICATION: equus monoceros\n",
    "```\n",
    "{: .output}\n",
    "> ## Follow the Prompt\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The shell prompt changes from `$` to `>` and back again as we were\n",
    "> typing in our loop. The second prompt, `>`, is different to remind\n",
    "> us that we haven't finished typing a complete command yet. A semicolon, `;`,\n",
    "> can be used to separate two commands written on a single line.\n",
    "{: .callout}\n",
    "When the shell sees the keyword `for`,\n",
    "it knows to repeat a command (or group of commands) once for each item in a list.\n",
    "Each time the loop runs (called an iteration), an item in the list is assigned in sequence to\n",
    "the **variable**, and the commands inside the loop are executed, before moving on to\n",
    "the next item in the list.\n",
    "Inside the loop,\n",
    "we call for the variable's value by putting `$` in front of it.\n",
    "The `$` tells the shell interpreter to treat\n",
    "the variable as a variable name and substitute its value in its place,\n",
    "rather than treat it as text or an external command.\n",
    "In this example, the list is three filenames: `basilisk.dat`, `minotaur.dat`, and `unicorn.dat`.\n",
    "Each time the loop iterates, it will assign a file name to the variable `filename`\n",
    "and run the `head` command.\n",
    "The first time through the loop,\n",
    "`$filename` is `basilisk.dat`.\n",
    "The interpreter runs the command `head` on `basilisk.dat`\n",
    "and pipes the first two lines to the `tail` command,\n",
    "which then prints the second line of `basilisk.dat`.\n",
    "For the second iteration, `$filename` becomes\n",
    "`minotaur.dat`. This time, the shell runs `head` on `minotaur.dat`\n",
    "and pipes the first two lines to the `tail` command,\n",
    "which then prints the second line of `minotaur.dat`.\n",
    "For the third iteration, `$filename` becomes\n",
    "`unicorn.dat`, so the shell runs the `head` command on that file,\n",
    "and `tail` on the output of that.\n",
    "Since the list was only three items, the shell exits the `for` loop.\n",
    "> ## Same Symbols, Different Meanings\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Here we see `>` being used as a shell prompt, whereas `>` is also\n",
    "> used to redirect output.\n",
    "> Similarly, `$` is used as a shell prompt, but, as we saw earlier,\n",
    "> it is also used to ask the shell to get the value of a variable.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> If the *shell* prints `>` or `$` then it expects you to type something,\n",
    "> and the symbol is a prompt.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> If *you* type `>` or `$` yourself, it is an instruction from you that\n",
    "> the shell should redirect output or get the value of a variable.\n",
    "{: .callout}\n",
    "When using variables it is also\n",
    "possible to put the names into curly braces to clearly delimit the variable\n",
    "name: `$filename` is equivalent to `${filename}`, but is different from\n",
    "`${file}name`. You may find this notation in other people's programs.\n",
    "We have called the variable in this loop `filename`\n",
    "in order to make its purpose clearer to human readers.\n",
    "The shell itself doesn't care what the variable is called;\n",
    "if we wrote this loop as:"
